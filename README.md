# TA_network-port-numbers

A Splunk technology add-on (TA) to enrich network port numbers with service names and descriptions.

## Purpose

This TA adds fields to any event that contains a `transport` field and either a `dest_port` or `src_port` field.
These fields are elements of the Splunk Common Information Model for networking.

Depending on which fields are available in an event, service fields and service description fields may be added -- if they are registered with IANA.
The following table lists the added fields (in **bold**). If both dest and src exist, both sets of service fields may be added.

| transport | port | service | service description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `transport` | `dest_port` | **`dest_svc`** | **`dest_svc_description`** |
| `transport` | `src_port` | **`src_svc`** | **`src_svc_description`** |

## Prerequisites and Dependencies

The TA should be installed only on search heads. It can be deployed to a search head cluster via a deployer. It will run on Linux or Windows.

Once per month (by default), the TA runs a scheduled search (named `network-port-numbers_update_iana_ports`) that updates the lookup table with the latest port information from [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers).
This functionality requires Splunk 8.0 or later (i.e. Python 3). The search heads should have Internet web access for this to work.

## Developer

The TA was developed by Frank Wayne.
